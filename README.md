## Hi there 👋
My name is Rone Kohut, but I'm decently known on the internet as either RoninThedev (Newer username) or Gamewarrior1andBowser (Old username). I'm a nerd with a knack for storytelling and fidgeting with stuff... whether it be fixing computers, making video games, writing my own novel series or helping others out.
